I first heard Hamilton while visiting my friend in St. Louis for her birthday.  For that entire weekend, I heard the same songs from the soundtrack on repeat.  She kept humming the same lines over and over:

*Oui oui, mon ami, je m’apelle Lafeyette!<br />
The Lancelot of the Revolutionary set!<br />
I came from afar, just to say “Bonsoir!”<br />
Tell the King, “Casse toi!” Who’s the best?<br />
C’est moi!*

Catchy as it was, I hated the song by day two, and was ready to throttle her by day three.  Needless to say, I flew back to San Francisco cursing Hamilton.

The second time I heard about Hamilton, I was in New York.  I was having coffee with a friend when he told me about being in a car with Hamilton for two hours.  He was doubtful at first (“a hip-hop musical?”), but as it went on, he couldn’t get over how unexpectedly transformative it was (“why am I crying over some guy I don’t even know?”).

After that glowing review, I knew I had to at least give it a try.
