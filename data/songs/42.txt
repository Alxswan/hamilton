The election of 1800
Can we get back to politics?
Please?
Yo. Ev’ry action has an equal, opposite reaction
John Adams shat the bed. I love the guy, but he’s in traction
Poor Alexander Hamilton? He is missing in action
So now I’m facing—
Aaron Burr!
With his own faction
He’s very attractive in the North. New Yorkers like his chances
He’s not very forthcoming on any particular stances
Ask him a question: it glances off, he obfuscates, he dances
And they say I’m a Francophile: at least they know I know where France is!
Thomas that’s the problem, see, they see Burr as a less extreme you
Ha!
You need to change course, a key endorsement might redeem you
Who did you have in mind?
Don’t laugh
Who is it?
You used to work on the same staff
Whaaaat
It might be nice, it might be nice
To get Hamilton on your side
It might be nice, it might be nice
To get Hamilton on your side
Talk less!
Smile more!
Don’t let ‘em know what you’re against or what you’re for!
Shake hands with him!
Charm her!
It’s eighteen hundred, ladies, tell your husbands: vote for
Burr!
I don’t like Adams
Well, he’s gonna lose, that’s just defeatist
And Jefferson—
In love with France!
Yeah, he’s so elitist!
I like that Aaron Burr!
I can’t believe we’re here with him!
He seems approachable…?
Like you could grab a beer with him!
Dear Mr. Hamilton: your fellow Fed’ralists would like to know how you’ll be voting
It’s quiet uptown
Dear Mr. Hamilton: John Adams doesn’t stand a chance, so who are you promoting?
It’s quiet uptown
Jefferson or Burr?
We know it’s lose-lose
Jefferson or Burr?
But if you had to choose
Dear Mr. Hamilton:
John Adams doesn’t stand a chance so who are you promoting?
But if you had to choose
Well, if it isn’t Aaron Burr. Sir!
Alexander!
You’ve created quite a stir, sir!
I’m going door to door!
You’re openly campaigning?
Sure!
That’s new
Honestly, it’s kind of draining
Burr—
Sir!
Is there anything you wouldn’t do?
No. I’m chasing what I want
And you know what?
What?
I learned that from you
If you had to choose
If you had to choose
It’s a tie!
If you had to choose
If you had to choose
It’s up to the delegates!
If you had to choose
If you had to choose
It’s up to Hamilton!
If you had to choose
If you had to choose
If you had to
Choose
Choose
Choose!
Yo
Oh!
The people are asking to hear my voice
Oh!
For the country is facing a difficult choice
Oh!
And if you were to ask me who I’d promote—
Oh!
—Jefferson has my vote
Oh!
I have never agreed with Jefferson once
Oh!
We have fought on like seventy-five diff’rent fronts
Oh!
But when all is said and all is done
Jefferson has beliefs. Burr has none
Oooooooooooooh
Well, I’ll be damned
Well, I’ll be damned
Hamilton’s on your side
Well, I’ll be damned
Well, I’ll be damned
And?
You won in a landslide
Congrats on a race well-run
I did give you a fight
Uh-huh
I look forward to our partnership
Our partnership?
As your vice-President
Ha. Yeah, right
You hear this guy? Man openly campaigns against me, talkin’ bout, “I look forward to our partnership.”
It’s crazy that the guy who comes in second gets to be Vice President
Yeah, you know what? We can change that. You know why?
Why?
‘cuz I’m the President. Hey, Burr, when you see Hamilton, thank him for the endorsement
