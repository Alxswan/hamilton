How does Hamilton the short-tempered protean creator of the Coast Guard
Founder of the New York Post
Ardently abuse his cab’net post
Destroy his reputation?
Welcome, folks, to
The Adams administration!
Jefferson’s the runner-up, which makes him the Vice President
Washington can’t help you now, no more mister nice President
Adams fires Hamilton
Privately calls him “creole bastard” in his taunts
Say what!
Hamilton publishes his response
Sit down, John, you fat mother—BLEEP
Hamilton is out of control
This is great! He’s out of power. He holds no office. And he just destroyed President John Adams, the only other significant member of his party
Hamilton’s a host unto himself. As long as he can hold a pen, he’s a threat. Let’s let him know what we know
