Hear ye, hear ye! My name is Samuel Seabury
And I present “Free Thoughts on the Proceedings of the Continental Congress!”
Heed not the rabble who scream revolution
They have not your interests at heart
Oh my God. Tear this dude apart
Chaos and bloodshed are not a solution
Don’t let them lead you astray
This Congress does not speak for me
Let him be
They’re playing a dangerous game
I pray the king shows you his mercy
For shame, for shame…
Yo!
He’d have you all unravel at the
Sound of screams but the
Revolution is comin’
The have-nots are gonna
Win this
It’s hard to listen to you with a straight face
Chaos and bloodshed already haunt us, honestly you shouldn’t even talk. And what about Boston? Look at the cost, n’ all that we’ve lost n’ you talk
About Congress?!
My dog speaks more eloquently than thee!
But strangely, your mange is the same
Is he in Jersey?
For the revolution!
Heed—
If you repeat yourself again I’m gonna—
Scream—
Honestly, look at me, please don’t read!
Not your interests—
Don’t modulate the key then not debate with me!
Why should a tiny island across the sea regulate the price of tea?
Alexander, please!
Burr, I’d rather be divisive than indecisive, drop the niceties
Silence! A message from the King!
A message from the King!
A message from the King!
