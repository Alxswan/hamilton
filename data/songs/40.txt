Stay alive…
Stay alive…
Stay alive...
Where’s my son?
Mr. Hamilton, come in. They brought him in a half an hour ago. He lost a lot of blood on the way over.
Is he alive?
Yes. But you have to understand
The bullet entered just above his hip and lodged in his right arm
Can I see him please?
I’m doing ev’rything I can, but the wound was already infected when he arrived—
Philip
Pa
I did exactly as you said, Pa
I held my head up high
I know, I know. Shh
I know, I know
Shh. I know you did
Ev’rything just right
Shh
I know, I know
I know, I know
I know
Save your strength and
Stay alive…
No!

Is he breathing? Is he going to survive this?
Who did this, Alexander, did you know?
Mom, I’m so sorry for forgetting what you taught me
My son—
We played piano
I taught you piano
You would put your hands on mine
You changed the melody every time
Ha. I would always change the line
Shh. I know, I know
I would always change the line
I know, I know
Un deux trois quatre
Cinq six sept huit neuf
Good
Un deux trois quatre
Cinq six sept
Huit neuf
Sept huit neuf—
Sept huit…
